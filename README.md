# ✈️ WayRishi | Uncover New Horizons

Hello 👋, In this repository, I have built a complete full-stack web application, "WayRishi | Uncover New Horizons," using Node.js, MongoDB, React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap.

Are you interested in this project? Let's connect and explore something new! Thanks!

## 🧑‍💻 Development Stack

- `Backend` - Node.js & MongoDB Database
- `Frontend` - React.js

## ⚙️ Setting Up Backend

To set up the backend for this project, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/otaku-codes/WayRishi
```

```bash
cd WayRishi
```

#### Step 2: Create Your MongoDB Account and Database Cluster

- Create your own MongoDB account by visiting the MongoDB website and signing up for a new account and create a new database or cluster.

#### Step 3: Edit the Environment File

- Create a file named .env in the /backend directory.

#### Step 4: Update MongoDB URI

In the .env file, find the line that reads:

`PORT = 4000`
`MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_uri"`
`JWT_SECRET_KEY="random_key"`
`EMAIL_USER="your_gmail"`
`EMAIL_PASS="your_pass"`

Replace "your_mongodb_uri" with the actual URI of your MongoDB database and EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS with gmail App password.

#### Step 5: Install Backend Dependencies

In your terminal, navigate to the /backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

the run the following command to install the backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

after that run command to start backend server

```bash
npm start server
```

## 🖥️ Setting Up Frontend

#### Step 1: Install Frontend Dependencies

Open a new terminal window , and run the following command to install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
```

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 2: Run the Frontend Server

After installing the frontend dependencies, run the following command in the same terminal to start the frontend server:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the frontend server, and you'll be able to access the website on localhost:3000 in your web browser.
